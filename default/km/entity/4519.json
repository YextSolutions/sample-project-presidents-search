Prior to his presidency , he served as governor of Arkansas (1979–1981 and 1983–1992) and as attorney general of Arkansas (1977–1979). A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton was known as a New Democrat , and many of his policies reflected a centrist \" Third Way \" political philosophy. He is the husband of former secretary of state, former U.S. senator, and two-time candidate for president Hillary Clinton . Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University , 1 University College, Oxford , and Yale Law School . He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and they were married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state\u0027s education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association . Clinton was elected president in 1992 , defeating incumbent Republican President George H. W. Bush . At age 46, he became the third-youngest president in history. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform . In the 1994 elections , the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996 , Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. He passed welfare reform and the State Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program , as well as financial deregulation measures. He also appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court . During the last three years of Clinton\u0027s presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Dayton Peace agreement , signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein , participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process , and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process . In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives , becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson . 2 The impeachment was based on accusations that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice for the purpose of concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky , a 22-year-old White House intern . He was acquitted by the Senate and completed his second term in office. Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II , and his presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents . However, he has also been subject to substantial criticism for his sex scandals and lies , especially in the wake of the Me Too movement . Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming . In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life . In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti , and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake , he teamed up with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund . In addition, he secured the release of two American journalists imprisoned by North Korea , visiting the capital Pyongyang in 2009 and negotiating their release with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-il . He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife Hillary\u0027s presidential campaigns in the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections. Contents e Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas . 3 4 He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr. , a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley). 5 His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife. 6 Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. 4 At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated , Clinton\u0027s grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races. 4 7 8 9 10 In 1950, Bill\u0027s mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr. , who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas , with his brother and Earl T. Ricks . 4 The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950. 11 Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather\u0027s surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15 12 that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward him. 4 Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr. He threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them. 4 13 In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John\u0027s Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School , where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician. 4 Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone , winning first chair in the state band\u0027s saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life : Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz . I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey . But I knew I could be great in public service. 4 Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class. 14 After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\". 15 Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy . 4 13 The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr. \u0027s 1963 \" I Have a Dream \" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that he later memorized it. 16 College and law school years Georgetown University Clinton ran for president of the Student Council while attending the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University . With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968. In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president . 17 From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright . 4 While in college, he became a brother of service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega 18 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa . Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay , 19 a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry , but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity. 20 Oxford Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford , where he initially read for a B.Phil. in philosophy, politics, and economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics. 21 Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School , Yale University , and so he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford. 13 22 23 During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War . Aller\u0027s 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. 21 24 British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn\u0027t good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren\u0027t enough and you had to do something about such things\". 21 Clinton was a member of the Oxford University Basketball Club and also played for Oxford University\u0027s rugby union team. 25 While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford , specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\". 22 26 Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969. 27 While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969. 4 He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard and the Air Force officer candidate school , and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers\u0027 Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas . 28 29 He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\". 30 Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.) 31 Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton\u0027s ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign: I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright\u0027s office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the ROTC program ... I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification. 32 During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton\u0027s uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve , which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. 33 Although legal, Clinton\u0027s actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright\u0027s influence to avoid military service. 34 35 Clinton\u0027s 1992 campaign manager, James Carville , successfully argued that Clinton\u0027s letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position. 36 Law school After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973. 4 13 In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library ; she was a class year ahead of him. 4 37 They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California. 38 The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school. 39 Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern\u0027s effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas , at the campaign\u0027s local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk , 40 future governor of Texas Ann Richards , 41 and then unknown television director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg . 42 Bill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea , was born on February 27, 1980. 37 Governor of Arkansas (1979–1981, 1983–1992) Further information: Electoral history of Bill Clinton Results of the 1978 Arkansas gubernatorial election. Clinton won the counties in blue. After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives . Running in the conservative 3rd district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt , Clinton\u0027s campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal . Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas attorney general . With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, 43 Clinton was elected. 13 Newly elected Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton meets with President Jimmy Carter in 1978, fifteen years before assuming the nation\u0027s highest office. In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state\u0027s history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978 , having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe , a farmer from Texarkana . Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas. 44 Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\". 45 46 47 He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas\u0027s roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens\u0027 anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift ) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County , polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose\u0027s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton\u0027s defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation\u0027s history. 13 Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey \u0027s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. 48 In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas\u0027s economy and improved the state\u0027s educational system. 49 For senior citizens , he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. 50 He became a leading figure among the New Democrats , a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan \u0027s landslide victory in 1984 , the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. 50 51 Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan\u0027s 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas. 13 Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation\u0027s Governors in the White House with President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan , 1987. In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton\u0027s wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation . The committee transformed Arkansas\u0027s education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers\u0027 salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session —the longest in Arkansas history. 49 Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. 13 50 He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990). 43 Also in the 1980s, the Clintons\u0027 personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration. 52 After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas. 13 53 According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions. 54 55 During Clinton\u0027s term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976). 56 As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection . Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988. 57 1988 Democratic presidential primaries In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the presidential race after incumbent New York governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities. 58 Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). 59 For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis . He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention , but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long 60 and poorly delivered. 61 Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991. 50 62 President (1993–2001) During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs , most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform , have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance. 63 64 His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters. 65 66 Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. 67 68 69 The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69 billion in 1998, $126 billion in 1999, and $236 billion in 2000, 70 during the last three years of Clinton\u0027s presidency. 71 Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000. 72 73 Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000. 74 At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York , in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York. 1992 presidential campaign Further information: 1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries , 1992 United States presidential election , and Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus , Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa senator Tom Harkin . During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary , reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers . Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. 13 Following Super Bowl XXVI , Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary , but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish. 75 Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. 13 62 With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. 62 Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown\u0027s home state of California. 13 The Clintons in a White House Christmas portrait During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm , at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary\u0027s firm pay. 4 76 Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\". 77 Clinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton\u0027s return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations. 54 78 Bush\u0027s approval ratings were around 80 percent during the Gulf War , and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. 62 By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent. 62 79 Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention —with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. 80 Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. 81 Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. 82 Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore , toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\". 82 On March 26, 1992, during a Democratic fund raiser of the presidential campaign, Robert Rafsky confronted then Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and asked what he was going to do about AIDS , to which Clinton replied, \"I feel your pain.\" 83 The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential election. On April 4, then candidate Clinton met with members of ACT UP and other leading AIDS advocates to discuss his AIDS agenda and agreed to make a major AIDS policy speech, to have people with HIV speak to the Democratic Convention , and to sign onto the AIDS United Action five point plan. 84 1992 electoral vote results Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush\u0027s steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton\u0027s success. 82 Clinton\u0027s victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress , 5 the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter . 85 86 First term (1993–1997) audio only version Problems playing these files? See media help . \"Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.\" Inaugural address, January 20, 1993. 87 Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 , which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, 88 and was popular with the public. 89 Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade —Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush. 90 Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"—a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning. 91 During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent. 92 On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit . 93 Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress , Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. 94 Clinton\u0027s advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates. 95 President Clinton\u0027s attorney general Janet Reno authorized the FBI\u0027s use of armored vehicles to deploy tear gas into the buildings of the Branch Davidian community near Waco, Texas, in hopes of ending a 51 day siege . During the operation on  April 19, 1993, the buildings caught fire and 75 of the residents died, including 24 children. 96 97 98 On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause . The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. 99 Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. 100 In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 , which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses, 101 and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over many years through the implementation of spending restraints. 102 Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the South Lawn, August 10, 1993 On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan ; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton\u0027s legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association , and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. 53 Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration. 50 53 In November 1993, David Hale —the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons\u0027 partner in the Whitewater land deal. 103 A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife\u0027s innocence in the affair. On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill , which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit , a subsidy for low-income workers. 53 In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator . In the affair later known as \" Troopergate \", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones . Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\". 104 Yitzhak Rabin , Clinton and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993 That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \" Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell \", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual\u0027s sexual orientation. 105 The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton\u0027s proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner , Clinton\u0027s support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban ... even though his executive order was sure to be overridden by the Congress\". 106 Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. 107 Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton\u0027s defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. 50 Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\". 108 The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011 , removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces. 109 audio only version Problems playing these files? See media help . On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law. 110 Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president. 110 The Omnibus Crime Bill , which Clinton signed into law in September 1994, 111 made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton\u0027s re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\" 112 It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period. 113 On October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov . 114 115 The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. 116 117 The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America\u0027s government to more of America\u0027s citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011—Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\" 118 After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994 , for the first time in forty years. 119 A speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 White House Conference on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. The President focused on his administration\u0027s accomplishments and efforts related to the epidemic , including an accelerated drug-approval process. He also condemned homophobia and discrimination against people with HIV . Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the Federal government ; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the Justice Department to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS. 120 Clinton\u0027s coat of arms, granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1995 The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. 121 In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray\u0027s report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files. 122 On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states. 123 Paul Yandura , speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton\u0027s signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\". 124 Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\" 125 Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it\u0027s obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\". 126 Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\". 125 In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\" 127 Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013. 128 Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, 129 and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. 130 During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees 131 and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. 132 Under Clinton\u0027s leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. 133 Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. 134 Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton\u0027s election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign . 130 Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 135 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. 136 He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA. 137 \"When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web ... Now even my cat has its own page.\" Bill Clinton\u0027s announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative , October 1996. 138 The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by China to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. 139 140 Despite the evidence, 139 141 the Chinese government denied all accusations. 142 As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration , Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton, 143 the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000. 144 145 Ken Gormley , author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). 146 According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\". 147 Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti , former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service . Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge. 146 This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton\u0027s motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. 147 Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. 147 Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. 148 Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag. 149 Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. 149 The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden . 147 Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events. 147 1996 presidential election 1996 electoral vote results In the 1996 presidential election , Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4 percent of the popular vote). Clinton received 379 of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. He became the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once. 150 Second term (1997–2001) In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy —a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch —a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act . Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. 151 In 1999, he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act , which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment , commercial banking , and insurance services since its enactment in 1933. 152 Impeachment and acquittal Main articles: Impeachment of Bill Clinton and Impeachment trial of Bill Clinton Clinton\u0027s impeachment trial in 1999 After a House inquiry , Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228–206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury 153 and voted 221–212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice. 154 Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson ) to be impeached. 155 156 Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense ) employee Monica Lewinsky . 157 After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\", 158 the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections . To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. Future president Donald Trump and Clinton shaking hands at Trump Tower , June 2000 While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton\u0027s testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton , Paula Jones\u0027s sexual harassment lawsuit. 159 The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges. 160 The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams \u0026 Connolly . 161 The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 not guilty/45 guilty on the perjury charge 160 and 50 not guilty/50 guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. 162 Both votes fell short of the constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty. 160 On January 19, 2001, Clinton\u0027s law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case. 163 164 Pardons and commutations Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001. 53 165 Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton\u0027s brother, Hugh Rodham , accepted payments in return for influencing the president\u0027s decision-making regarding the pardons. 166 Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey , who found no wrongdoing on Clinton\u0027s part. Some of Clinton\u0027s pardons remain a point of controversy. 167 Military and foreign affairs Col. Paul Fletcher , USAF and Clinton speak before boarding Air Force One , November 4, 1999. Somalia The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors , trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. 168 In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. 169 Rwanda In April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda . Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was underway, long before the administration publicly used the word \"genocide\". 170 171 172 Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene. 173 President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don\u0027t think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\" 174 Bosnia and Herzegovina Clinton meeting with Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović in Tuzla , Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 22, 1997. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war . Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement . 169 Irish peace talks In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland , but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the UK government . In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Féin , the IRA \u0027s political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit Northern Ireland , seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously shaking Adams\u0027 hand, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles . 175 Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks , which eventually led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. 176 Clinton plays the saxophone presented to him by Russian president Boris Yeltsin at a private dinner in Russia, January 13, 1994 Iran In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million (equivalent to $214.86 million in 2019) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser . 177 Osama bin Laden Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden\u0027s death in 2011 ). 178 Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer, 179 the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\". 180 In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden 181 and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan , targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden\u0027s terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. 182 Kosovo Clinton greets Air Force personnel at Spangdahlem Air Base , May 5, 1999. In the midst of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force . 183 The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide ) 184 185 of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region. 186 NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat, 187 though two died in an Apache helicopter crash. 188 Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated. 189 190 Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing. 191 192 In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\". 193 In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population. 194 The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference. 195 Slobodan Milošević , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war. 196 He died in 2006, before the completion of the trial. 196 197 Iraq In Clinton\u0027s 1998 State of the Union Address , he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons: Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation\u0027s wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq\u0027s arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world\", and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again. 198 Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak , President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David , July 2000 Seeking to weaken Hussein\u0027s grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces. 199 200 The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox , lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\" 201 American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000. 202 203 Vietnam Clinton\u0027s November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War. 204 China See also: 1996 United States campaign finance controversy Clinton and Chinese president Jiang Zemin holding a joint press conference at the White House, October 29, 1997 On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000 , which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to China. 205 The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. 206 Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969. 207 Relations were damaged for a time by the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental. 208 The U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton. 209 210 211 President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China\u0027s accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America\u0027s economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets—with a fifth of the world\u0027s population, potentially the biggest markets in the world—to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton. 212 U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000. 213 Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated. 214 215 Israeli-Palestinian conflict After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . He brought Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days. 53 Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit. 4 216 Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base , in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters , the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada . 53 Judicial appointments Main articles: Bill Clinton Supreme Court candidates and List of federal judges appointed by Bill Clinton Ruth Bader Ginsburg accepting her nomination to the Supreme Court from President Clinton, 1993 Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court : Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 217 and Stephen Breyer in 1994. 218 Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts . His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced many judicial appointment controversies , as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican -controlled Senate Judiciary Committee . In all, 84 percent of his nominees were confirmed. 219 Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the Second Circuit . Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition. 220 221 Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. 222 In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton\u0027s court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. 222 Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit ( Roger Gregory ) and the Seventh Circuit ( Ann Claire Williams ). 222 Clinton also appointed the nation\u0027s first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York . Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994. 223 Public opinion Clinton\u0027s approval ratings throughout his presidential career (Roper Center) Throughout Clinton\u0027s first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s. 224 After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton\u0027s rating reached its highest point. 225 According to a CBS News /New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. 226 Clinton\u0027s average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years. 227 Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters. 227 As he was leaving office, a CNN/ USA Today /Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55 percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58 percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\" 227 The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22 percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\". 227 ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can\u0027t trust him, he\u0027s got weak morals and ethics—and he\u0027s done a heck of a good job.\" 228 Public opinion of Bill Clinton (Gallup) 229 In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton\u0027s job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned. 230 Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history. 231 232 In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. 233 The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II. 233 A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent. 234 Public image Main article: Public image of Bill Clinton Clinton addressing the British parliament on November 29, 1995 Clinton was the first baby boomer president. 235 Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton\u0027s innovative use of sound bite -ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings. 236 237 When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show , he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\". 238 Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg ; 239 Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller , Dale Bumpers and David Pryor . 239 The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency. 240 Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), Clinton is tied with four others as the fifth-tallest president in the nation\u0027s history. 241 242 His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba , especially in the South. 243 Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\". 244 245 His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention , where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\". 246 247 Clinton at a Democratic \" Get out the vote \" rally in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2000 Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency. 248 In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald\u0027s -and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\". 249 Morrison noted that Clinton\u0027s sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure. 249 Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large. 250 Clinton, a Baptist , 251 has been open about his faith. 252 The state funeral of George H. W. Bush in December 2018 Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife , a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clinton\u0027s past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency. 253 Leading the Arkansas Project , Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton\u0027s home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president. 253 Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . 254 Sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations Main article: Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on February 28, 1997 Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton\u0027s sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement , with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair. 255 256 257 In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit. 258 Jones appealed Webber Wright\u0027s ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton\u0027s admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. 259 In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett , Clinton\u0027s main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton\u0027s political enemies. 260 Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. 261 Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. 262 During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, 263 Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky—a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury. 264 In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. 265 On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit , accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey\u0027s account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. 266 An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. 267 Linda Tripp \u0027s grand jury testimony also differed from Willey\u0027s claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances. 268 Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date. 269 To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press. 270 Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition. 269 In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly. 269 The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton\u0027s legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998. 271 In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment , especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning. 272 During the 2018 Congressional elections , The New York Times alleged that having no Democratic candidate for office asking Clinton to campaign with him or her was a change that attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal. 271 However, former DNC interim chair Donna Brazile previously urged Clinton in November 2017 to campaign during the 2018 midterm elections, in spite of New York U.S. senator Kirsten Gillibrand \u0027s recent criticism of the Lewinsky scandal. 273 Post-presidency (2001–present) Main article: Post-presidency of Bill Clinton Clinton greets a Hurricane Katrina evacuee, September 5, 2005. In the background, second from the right, is then-Senator Barack Obama . Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations, 274 and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention. 275 Activities until 2008 campaign In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences, 276 277 and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this). 278 In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal. 279 The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas , was dedicated in 2004. 280 Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life , in 2004. 281 In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World , which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews. 282 Former president George H. W. Bush and Clinton in the White House Library, January 2005 In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami , U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort. 283 After Hurricane Katrina , Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. 284 As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show, 285 and traveled to the affected areas. 286 They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007. 287 Based on his philanthropic worldview, 288 Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health , poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict . 289 In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. 290 Clinton\u0027s foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. 291 The foundation has received donations from many governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. 292 In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations. 293 Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy , which was voted down. 294 In the early 2000s, Clinton took flights on Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s private jet in connection with Clinton Foundation work. 295 296 Years later, Epstein was convicted on sex trafficking charges. Clinton\u0027s office released a statement in 2019 saying, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York. In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. ... He\u0027s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade.\" 295 297 298 2008 presidential election Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign , Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10 million toward her campaign. 299 Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad. 300 Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary\u0027s staffs, especially in Pennsylvania. 301 Considering Bill\u0027s remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary. 302 Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama\u0027s election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention , saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\". 303 After Hillary Clinton\u0027s presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt. 304 305 After the 2008 election Clinton with then-President Barack Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett in July 2010 Clinton, his wife Hillary , and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City on September 29, 2014 In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China. 306 Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994. 306 After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il , Kim issued a pardon. 307 308 Since then, Clinton has been assigned many other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages. 309 Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\". 310 In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake , U.S. president Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti\u0027s recovery. 311 Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company\u0027s deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the U.S. State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant. 310 In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR , Ireland\u0027s first environmental foundation. 312 313 At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama. 314 2016 presidential election Clinton campaigning at an election rally for his wife Hillary who was running for President of the United States, 2016 Clinton holding a dog on the campaign trail in New York City . Photo by Adam Schultz Clinton speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention During the 2016 presidential election , Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, and made appearances speaking on the campaign trail. 315 In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote. 316 Clinton served as a member of the electoral college for the state of New York. 317 He voted for the Democratic ticket consisting of his wife Hillary and her running-mate Tim Kaine . After the 2016 election On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. 318 In 2020 , Clinton again served as a member of the United States Electoral College from New York, casting his vote for the successful Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris . 319 320 The Clintons attended Biden\u0027s inauguration on January 20, 2021, alongside George W. Bush , Laura Bush , Barack Obama and Michelle Obama . Post-presidential health concerns In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery. 321 In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung. 322 On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart. 321 323 After this procedure, Clinton adopted a plant-based whole foods ( vegan ) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn . 324 However, he has since incorporated fish and lean proteins at the suggestion of Dr. Mark Hyman , a proponent of the pseudoscientific ethos of functional medicine . 325 As a result, he is no longer a strict vegan. 326 Wealth The Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office. 327 Bill and Hillary Clinton have each earned millions of dollars from book publishing. 328 In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). 329 Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. 330 In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices , during the same time period. 331 In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. 332 Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. 333 In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons\u0027 income tax returns 334 show they made $109 million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing. 328 335 336 337 Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. 330 338 339 340 Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow . 341 342 Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea\u0027s education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard ... we had to pay off all our debts ... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\" 336 Honors and recognition Main article: List of honors and awards received by Bill Clinton Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees 343 344 and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees. 345 He is an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar , although he did not complete his studies there. 346 347 Schools have been named for Clinton, 348 349 350 and statues have been built to pay him homage. 351 352 U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri, 353 Arkansas, 354 Kentucky, 355 and New York. 356 He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001. 357 The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001. 358 He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic, 359 Papua New Guinea, 360 Germany, 361 and Kosovo. 351 The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War , renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue. 362 363 364 Clinton was selected as Time \u0027s \" Man of the Year \" in 1992, 365 and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr . 366 From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup\u0027s List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century. 367 He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children , a J.
