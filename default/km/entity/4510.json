Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address , and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton , Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain and was inaugurated alongside his running mate, Joe Biden , on January 20, 2009.

Contents Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama Stanley Armour Dunham, Ann Dunham, Maya Soetoro and Barack Obama, (L to R) mid-1970s in Honolulu Obama was born on August 4, 1961, 5 at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu , Hawaii. 6 7 8 He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states . 9 He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas ; she was mostly of English descent, 10 with some German, Irish, Scottish, 11 12 13 14 15 Swiss, and Welsh ancestry. 16 In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch , an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. 17 18 Obama\u0027s father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), 19 was a married 20 21 22 Luo Kenyan from Nyang\u0027oma Kogelo . 20 23 Obama\u0027s parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa , where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. 24 25 The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii , on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born. 26 27 In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle , where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University , where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama\u0027s parents divorced in March 1964. 28 Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance. 29 He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, 30 before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. 31 Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\" 25 He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage. 32 In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii ; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography . The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965. 33 After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa , Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet sub district of south Jakarta . From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng sub district of central Jakarta . 34 Education Barack Obama\u0027s school record in St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School. Obama was enlisted as Barry Soetoro in the school (no. 1) and was wrongly acknowledged as a Muslim (no. 4). 35 When he was six years old, Obama and his mother moved to Indonesia to join his step-father; from age six to ten, he attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. 36 37 As a result of those four years in Jakarta , he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. 38 39 40 During his time in Indonesia, Obama\u0027s step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\". 41 In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham . He attended Punahou School —a private college preparatory school —with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. 42 In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry\". 43 Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro , in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii . 44 Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. 45 His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer . 46 Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\" 47 Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol , marijuana , and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind\". 48 Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang\", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. 49 50 After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation\u0027s policy of apartheid . 51 In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. 51 Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior , where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations 52 and in English literature 53 and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. 54 He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA . After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation , where he was a financial researcher and writer, 55 56 then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985. 57 58 59 Family and personal life Main article: Family of Barack Obama In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family : \"It\u0027s like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac , and I\u0027ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher .\" 60 Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father\u0027s family—six of them living. 61 Obama\u0027s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham , 62 until her death on November 2, 2008, 63 two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011. 64 In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother\u0027s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis , President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War . He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , among others. 65 66 67 Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. 68 He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down. 68 69 The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended. 69 Obama poses in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009 In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin . 70 Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama\u0027s adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. 71 They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. 72 After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children. 73 The couple\u0027s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, 74 followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001. 75 The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools . When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School . 76 The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs ; the first, a male named Bo , was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy . 77 In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny , a female. 78 Obama takes a left-handed jump shot during a pickup game on the White House basketball court, 2009 Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox , and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. 79 In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. 80 He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL , but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers , and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president. 81 In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster . 82 He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school\u0027s varsity team, 83 and he is left-handed. 84 In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago . 85 The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko —attracted media attention because of Rezko\u0027s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama. 86 In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama\u0027s net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) . 87 Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books. 88 89 On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation , a charity assisting wounded veterans\u0027 families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. 90 91 Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million. 92 In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband\u0027s smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking. 93 94 On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in Glamour , in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a feminist . 95 96 97 Religious views Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. 98 He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household\". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person ... I have ever known\", and \"a lonely witness for secular humanism \". He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist \" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful\". Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change\". 99 The Obamas worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013 In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today : \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\" 100 On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I\u0027m a Christian by choice. My family didn\u0027t—frankly, they weren\u0027t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn\u0027t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers\u0027 and sisters\u0027 keeper, treating others as they would treat me . 101 102 Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992. 103 During Obama\u0027s first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright\u0027s statements were criticized . 104 Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John\u0027s Episcopal Church , as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David , but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis. 105 106 107 Law career Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project , a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland , West Pullman , and Riverdale on Chicago\u0027s South Side . He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. 58 108 He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants\u0027 rights organization in Altgeld Gardens . 109 Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation , a community organizing institute. 110 In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time. 111 112 External video Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard , April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive 113 Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.

The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father . 120 University of Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book. 120 121 He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004. 122 From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois\u0027s Project Vote , a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain\u0027s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be. 123 He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill \u0026 Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.). 124 This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act . 125 The case was settled out of court. 126 Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees. 127 His law license became inactive in 2007. 128 129 From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago —which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation . 58 He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. 58 Legislative career Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998 Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois\u0027s 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park – Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn . 130 Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. 131 132 He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform , and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. 133 In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan\u0027s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures . 134 135 He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. 136 137 In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois\u0027s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one. 138 In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate\u0027s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. 139 He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. 133 140 141 142 During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. 143 Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. 144 2004 U.S. Senate campaign Main article: 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.

His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party. 154 Obama\u0027s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan , withdrew from the race in June 2004. 155 Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. 156 In the November 2004 general election , Obama won with 70 percent of the vote in a landslide. 157 U.S. Senate (2005–2008) Main article: United States Senate career of Barack Obama Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005, 158 becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus . 159 CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007.

On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois . 184 185 The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic \"House Divided\" speech in 1858. 184 186 Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War , increasing energy independence , and reforming the health care system , 187 in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change. 188 Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries . The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. 189 On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. 190 Outgoing President George W.

Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. 213 214 Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago\u0027s McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\" 215 216 Presidency (2009–2017) Obama takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol , January 20, 2009 The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. 217 He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , 218 but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds 219 220 221 and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. 222 Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. 223 He also revoked President George W. Bush \u0027s restoration of President Ronald Reagan \u0027s Mexico City policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion. 224 Domestic policy See also: Social policy of the Barack Obama administration The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 , relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits. 225 Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children\u0027s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional four million uninsured children. 226 In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research. 227 Obama delivers a speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009. Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter ; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009, 228 becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent. 229 Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens . She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history. 230 On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act , a reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 231 232 Obama meets with the Cabinet of the United States , November 23, 2009. In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA , the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program , in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station . 233 President Obama\u0027s 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks , and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and set a goal for 80 percent reliance on \" clean \" electricity by 2035. 234 235 LGBT rights On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act , a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim\u0027s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. 236 On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV , which was celebrated by Immigration Equality . 237 On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 , which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign 238 239 to end the don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces . 240 In 2016, the Pentagon also ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military . 241 As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing same-sex marriage . 242 By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. 243 In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\" 244 On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. 245 246 The White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015. During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, 216 Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address. 247 248 In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage ) 249 and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act ). 250 Then, following the Supreme Court\u0027s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\" 251 On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the Human Rights Campaign . 252 White House advisory and oversight groups On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls , which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs , having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. 253 The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett . 254 Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. 254 255 256 The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. 255 The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States , and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden. 257 Economic policy Obama presents his first weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession . 258 The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives , and direct assistance to individuals. 259 In March 2009, Obama\u0027s Treasury Secretary , Timothy Geithner , took further steps to manage the financial crisis , including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets , which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets. 260 Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry 261 in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms\u0027 bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat 262 and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12 percent stake. 263 In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. 264 He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System , known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", which temporarily boosted the economy. 265 266 267 The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009. 268 Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6 percent of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9 percent of GDP. 269 270 For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90 percent of GDP. 271 The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014. 272 On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation\u0027s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 . The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. 273 By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations. 274 US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama\u0027s tenure as U.S. President 275 276 As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. 277 Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. 278 By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, 279 decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013. 280 During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter. 281 GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter. 282 Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. 282 In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain\". 283 Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010. 284 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama\u0027s stimulus plan for economic growth. 285 286 The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million, 286 287 288 289 while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\" 285 Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. 290 The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II . 291 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union. 292 Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections , Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates , a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes . 293 The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010. 294 In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis \u0027 criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics . 295 Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership . 296 Environmental policy Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP oil spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana While campaigning, Obama expressed hope that Congress would regulate greenhouse gases and that, as a second-best route, such regulation would come from the Environmental Protection Agency. 297 On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming . 298 299 On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico , causing a major sustained oil leak . Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. 300 As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government. 301 In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions\". 302 303 Obama\u0027s advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013. 304 On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. 305 It was the third veto of Obama\u0027s presidency and his first major veto. 306 Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president. 307 308 309 310 Health care reform Main article: Healthcare reform in the United States Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010. Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States , a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. 311 He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option , to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions , and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans. 312 313 Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level , under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , starting in 2014 (Source: CRS ) 314 On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. 311 After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. 315 In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research. 316 On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House. 317 318 On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. 319 On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. 320 Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010. 321 The ACA includes health-related provisions , most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014, 322 subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, 323 324 providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges , prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level. 323 325 Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source: JAMA ) 326 The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets , taxes on indoor tanning , cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; 327 there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. 328 In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade. 329 The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress\u0027s taxing authority. 330 In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State\", as the statute reads. 331 Energy policy Main article: Energy policy of the Barack Obama administration Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic energy policy , which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy. 332 Obama\u0027s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation\u0027s available energy resources. 333 334 Gun control Obama visits an Aurora shooting victim at University of Colorado Hospital , 2012. On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control . 335 He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons , such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006. 336 On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. 337 In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women\u0027s suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history. 338 2010 midterm elections Main articles: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections and 2010 United States Senate elections Obama called the November 2, 2010 election , where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives, 339 \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking\". 340 He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery. 341 Cybersecurity and Internet policy On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality . 342 343 On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636 , \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity\". 344 Government mass surveillance Main article: Barack Obama on mass surveillance In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections. 345 346 347 In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties. 347 In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. 348 Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden , Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, 346 but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy. 349 350 The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however. 351 Foreign policy June 4, 2009 − after his speech A New Beginning at Cairo University , U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others Jamal Khashoggi , Bambang Harymurti and Nahum Barnea .

We see it and we condemn it.\" 358 While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden\u0027s comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\" 359 On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council . 360 In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem . 361 362 During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. 363 Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010. 364 Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the White House , October 2016. In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. 365 In August 2013, he criticized Russia\u0027s law that discriminates against gays, 366 but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia. 367 In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States . 368 The countries\u0027 respective \"interests sections\" in one another\u0027s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015. In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen , establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia. 369 370 In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion. 371 Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen\u0027s capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people. 372 Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president. 373 War in Iraq Main articles: Iraq War and American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present) On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\" 374 The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop\u0027s levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011.

McKiernan , with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal\u0027s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. 388 On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; 389 this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal\u0027s staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. 390 In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. 391 In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation. 392 Israel Obama meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres in the Oval Office , May 2009 In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements , with the United States being the only nation to do so. 393 Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps. 394 In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable\". 395 During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. 396 The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel . 397 In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama\u0027s view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\" 398 In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I\u0027ve been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\" 399 Obama expressed support for Israel\u0027s right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict . 400 In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal ; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad\". 401 On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 , which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. 402 Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration\u0027s actions, 403 404 and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017. 405 On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution. 406 407 Libya Main article: 2011 military intervention in Libya President Obama meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015. In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring . They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League , and a resolution 408 passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. 409 In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi 410 —announced an immediate cessation of military activities, 411 yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata . The next day, on Obama\u0027s orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government\u0027s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, 412 including the use of Tomahawk missiles , B-2 Spirits , and fighter jets. 413 414 415 Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector . 416 Some Representatives 417 questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath. 418 419 Syrian Civil War See also: Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States , and American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War , Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\" 420 421 This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. 422 In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. 423 The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015. 424 425 In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged 426 and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons ; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. 427 428 In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL . 429 Death of Osama bin Laden Also available: Audio only ; Full text   Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on Operation Neptune\u0027s Spear in the White House Situation Room , May 1, 2011. See also: Situation Room Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden . He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad . 430 CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. 430 Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs . 430 The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. 431 432 DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden\u0027s corpse, 433 which was buried at sea several hours later. 434 Within minutes of the President\u0027s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City\u0027s Ground Zero and Times Square . 431 435 Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. 436 Iran nuclear talks Main article: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013. On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 437 In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons , which included an interim agreement . Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 438 439 440 In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions\". 441 In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration \u0027s Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency . 442 443 On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House. 444 Relations with Cuba Main article: Cuban thaw President Obama meeting with Cuban President Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015 Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City . 445 The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. 446 On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro , in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg . 447 In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente. 448 Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw , The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama\u0027s finest foreign policy achievement\". 449 On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana . 450 The countries\u0027 respective \"interests sections\" in one another\u0027s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively. 451 Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. 452 Africa Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education , infrastructure, and economy . He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans. 453 454 During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father. 455 Hiroshima speech On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima , Japan, 71 years after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II .

After Russia\u0027s invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , 457 Obama\u0027s Russia policy was widely seen as a failure. 458 George Robertson , a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last. 459 Cultural and political image See also: International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election Obama\u0027s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement . 460 Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we\u0027re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\" 461 Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn\u0027t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\" 462 Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. 463 During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. 464 In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, 465 466 but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era. 467 Presidential approval ratings According to the Gallup Organization , Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating 468 before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010, 469 a trend similar to Ronald Reagan \u0027s and Bill Clinton \u0027s first years in office. 470 He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. 471 472 His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration. 473 Despite approval ratings dropping to 39 percent in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50 percent in January 2015 according to Gallup. 474 Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. 475 476 In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune , Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. 477 In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn. 478 479 G8 leaders watching the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final Obama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008. 480 His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can \", which was viewed ten million times on YouTube in its first month 481 and received a Daytime Emmy Award . 482 In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year . 483 The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments\". 484 On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall , London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state\u0027s being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. 485 486 On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\". 487 Obama accepted this award in Oslo , Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility\". 488 The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. 489 490 491 492 Obama\u0027s peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by The New York Times . 493 Some neoconservatives praised his speech for what they viewed as pro-American content. 494 495 He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. 496 Obama\u0027s Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad , said Obama\u0027s Peace Prize did not have the desired effect of encouraging the president. 497 Post-presidency (2017–present) Obama with his two successors, Joe Biden and Donald Trump , at the latter\u0027s inauguration on January 20, 2017 Obama\u0027s presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his Republican successor, Donald Trump .

While in Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves.

W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. 511 Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation in Chicago from October 31 to November 1, 2017. 512 Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office. 513 Obama has also written a presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with Penguin Random House . 514 The book, A Promised Land , was released on November 17, 2020. 515 516 517 Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China , India and France.

On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\" 525 526 Higher Ground\u0027s first film, American Factory , won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020. 527 A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Obama\u0027s home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018.

Trump retaliated by accusing Obama of having committed \"the biggest political crime in American history\", though he refused to say what he was talking about, telling reporters, \"You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody.\" 536 On May 16, 2020, Obama delivered two commencement speeches on behalf of the graduating youth who were not able to go to their physical graduation ceremonies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His first speech was for part of the video streamed online program, \"Show Me Your Walk H.B.C.U.

Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed. 541 Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system \u0027s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. 542 543 544 545 Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession . 541 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term. 546 In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act .

Roosevelt . 547 In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 , which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act , the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim\u0027s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaged in a federally protected activity. As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights. 548 In 2010, he signed the Don\u0027t Ask, Don\u0027t Tell Repeal Act , which brought an end to \" don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell \" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year. 549 In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. 550 241 A Gallup poll , taken in the final days of Obama\u0027s term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama\u0027s eight years in office. 551 Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban . 552 553 In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. 554 555 Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency. 556 557 According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics , from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter . By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan , George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush . 558 Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating. 559 560 A 2018 survey of historians by the American Political Science Association ranked Obama the 8th-greatest American President . 3 Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American President. 561 Presidential library The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama\u0027s planned presidential library .
