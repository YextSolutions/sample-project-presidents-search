Contents See also: Family of Joe Biden Biden at age 10 (1953) Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born November 20, 1942, 1 at St. Mary\u0027s Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania , 2 to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr. 3 4 The oldest child in a Catholic family, he has a sister, Valerie , and two brothers, Francis and James. 5 Jean was of Irish descent, 6 7 8 while Joseph Sr. had English , French , and Irish ancestry. 9 8 Biden\u0027s father had been wealthy, but suffered financial setbacks around the time Biden was born, 10 11 12 and for several years the family lived with Biden\u0027s maternal grandparents. 13 Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden\u0027s father could not find steady work. 14 Beginning in 1953, the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware , before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware . 13 Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman , maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle. 13 14 15 At Archmere Academy in Claymont, 16 Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team. 13 17 Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years. 18 19 He graduated in 1961. 20 At the University of Delaware in Newark , Biden briefly played freshman football 21 22 and, as an unexceptional student, 23 earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science , and a minor in English . 24 25 Biden has a stutter , which has improved since his early twenties. 26 He says he reduced it by reciting poetry before a mirror, 19 27 but it has been suggested that it affected his performance in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential debates . 28 Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1972) Biden in the University of Delaware \u0027s 1965 yearbook On August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter (1942–1972), a student at Syracuse University , 24 after overcoming her parents\u0027 reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic; the ceremony was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York . 29 They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III (1969–2015), Robert Hunter Biden (born 1970), and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden (1971–1972). 24 In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law , ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged \"mistake\" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school. 23 He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969. 30 In 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\". 31 32 He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry \u0027s conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson , who defeated Terry in 1968. 31 Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon . 31 In 1969, Biden practiced law first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat 33 31 who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party; 34 Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat. 31 He and another attorney also formed a law firm. 33 Corporate law , however, did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well. 13 He supplemented his income by managing properties. 35 In 1970, Biden ran for the 4th District Seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs. 36 33 37 The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts. 38 39 40 Biden won the general election, and took office on January 5, 1971. 41 42 He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift. 43 44 45 46 During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods. 47 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware Main article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware Results of the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs. 33 With minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning. 13 Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers, 48 an approach made feasible by Delaware\u0027s small size. 35 He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell . 33 His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\". 33 48 A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points, 33 but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters\u0027 emotions worked to his advantage, 15 and he won with 50.5 percent of the vote. 48 At the time of his election, he was still 29 years old, but reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in as Senator. 49 Death of wife and daughter On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden\u0027s wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware . 24 50 Neilia\u0027s station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) survived the accident and were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds, and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. 51 Biden considered resigning to care for them, 15 but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to. 52 Years later, Biden said he had heard that the truck driver allegedly drank alcohol before the collision. The driver\u0027s family denied that claim, and the police never substantiated it. Biden later apologized to the family. 53 54 55 56 57 The accident had filled him with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him, 58 and he had trouble focusing on work. 59 60 Second marriage Biden and his second wife, Jill , met in 1975 and married in 1977 Biden credits his second wife, teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs , with the renewal of his interest in politics and life; 61 they met in 1975 on a blind date 62 and were married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977. 63 64 They are Roman Catholics and attend Mass at St. Joseph\u0027s on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware . 65 Their daughter Ashley Blazer (born 1981) 24 is a social worker. She is married to physician Howard Krein . 66 Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General ; 67 he died of brain cancer in 2015. 68 69 Hunter Biden is a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser. 70 From 1991 to 2008, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law . 71 The seminar often had a waiting list. Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class. 72 73 74 75 U.S. Senate (1973–2009) In January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center . 76 77 Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members. 76 77 At 30, he was the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history . 78 79 To see his sons daily, 80 Biden commuted by train between his Delaware home and D.C.—90 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate. 15 During his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability. 81 In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens\u0027 concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription . 82 In his first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control . 83 84 After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter , Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u0027s objections. 85 When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT I treaty loosely to allow development of the Strategic Defense Initiative , Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty. 83 He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration\u0027s support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid . 31 Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan , 1984 Biden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act ; over time, the law\u0027s tough-on-crime provisions became controversial and in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\". 86 87 His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law\u0027s worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time. 88 This bill included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban 89 90 and the Violence Against Women Act , 91 which he has called his most significant legislation. 92 In 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces. 93 94 95 In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act , which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same. 96 In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges . 97 Opposition to busing In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate\u0027s strongest opponents of race-integration busing . His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies. 98 In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation , as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely. 99 In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary\u0027s power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment . 100 In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate; 101 he said busing was a \"bankrupt idea violating the cardinal rule of common sense\" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit. 88 At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights. 100 Biden supported a measure when? forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978. 102 Brain surgeries In February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm . 103 104 While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism , a serious complication. 104 After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May, 104 105 Biden\u0027s recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months. 106 Biden at the White House in 1987 1988 presidential campaign Main article: Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign Biden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987. 107 He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers ; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy . 31 108 109 He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate. 108 109 By August his campaign\u0027s messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries, 110 and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock . 111 Biden\u0027s speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions, 112 113 but did not on two occasions in late August. 114 :230–232 113 Earlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy\u0027s inaugural address ; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey . 115 Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson , had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used. 15 116 A few days later, an incident in law school in which he drew text from a Fordham Law Review article with inadequate citations was publicized. 116 Biden was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks. 117 At Biden\u0027s request the Delaware Supreme Court\u0027s Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules. 118 He made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class, 119 120 and that he had marched in the civil rights movement . 121 The limited amount of other news about the race amplified these revelations 122 and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew from the race, saying his candidacy had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes. 123 Biden met Kinnock in 1988, forming an enduring friendship. During his 2008 presidential run , Biden referenced the controversy by introducing Kinnock to his campaign staff and saying \"Folks, I want you to meet my greatest ever speechwriter.\" 124 Senate Judiciary Committee Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton in 1994 Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary . He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1997. As chairman, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings. 15 When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌given in an interview the previous year‍—‌of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered, 125 but at the hearings\u0027 close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage. 125 126 Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents, 15 Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork\u0027s strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text. 126 Bork\u0027s nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote 126 and then in the full Senate, 58–42. 127 During Clarence Thomas\u0027s nomination hearings in 1991, Biden\u0027s questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them, 128 and Thomas later wrote that Biden\u0027s questions were akin to \" beanballs \". 129 After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill , a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together. 130 131 Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify. 15 The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment, 132 saying he wanted to preserve Thomas\u0027s privacy and the hearings\u0027 decency. 128 132 The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed. 15 Liberal legal advocates and women\u0027s groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill. 132 Biden later sought out women to serve on the Judiciary Committee and emphasized women\u0027s issues in the committee\u0027s legislative agenda. 15 In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied. 133 Biden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it\u0027s going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers. 134 He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton . 135 During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers. 15 Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , 15 with Biden one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it. 136 As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security. 137 138 Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina in December 1997 Senate Foreign Relations Committee Biden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009. 139 His positions were generally liberal internationalist . 83 140 He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party. 139 140 During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy. 141 Biden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991, 140 siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition . 142 Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serb abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. 83 Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \" lift and strike \" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes . 83 139 The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. 83 140 In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević . 143 Biden related that he had told Milošević, \"I think you\u0027re a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one.\" 143 Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance the Clinton administration preferred, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman . 143 The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. 83 Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy. 140 In 1999, during the Kosovo War , Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . 83 He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo . 140 144 Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq Main article: War on terror Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan , saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\" 145 As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat. 146 In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq , approving the U.S. invasion of Iraq . 140 As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaida , and touted Iraq\u0027s fictional possession of weapons of mass destruction . 147 Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal. 140 143 He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length. 139 144 Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004 By late 2006, Biden\u0027s stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007 , 140 143 saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work. 148 Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. 149 In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb , president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations , released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq . 150 Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds , Shiites , and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions. 151 In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate, 150 but the idea was unfamiliar, had no political constituency, and failed to gain traction. 148 Iraq\u0027s political leadership denounced the resolution as de facto partitioning of the country, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement distancing itself from it. 150 In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush \u0027s speech to Israel \u0027s Knesset in which Bush compared some Democrats to Western leaders who appeased Hitler before World War II ; Biden called the speech \"bullshit\", \"malarkey\", and \"outrageous\". He later apologized for his language. 152 Reputation Official Senate photo, 2005 Elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978 , 1984 , 1990 , 1996 , 2002 , and 2008 , regularly receiving about 60% of the vote. 137 He was junior senator to William Roth , who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000. 153 As of 2020 update , he was the 18th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history. 154 Biden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate, 155 156 157 which he attributed to his having been elected young. 158 Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term. 88 The political writer Howard Fineman has written, \"Biden is not an academic, he\u0027s not a theoretical thinker, he\u0027s a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.\" 35 Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that\u0027s been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.\" 35 Journalist James Traub has written, \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself.\" 148 In 2006, Delaware newspaper columnist Harry F. Themal wrote that Biden \"occupies the sensible center of the Democratic Party\". 159 Journalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has described Biden as loquacious. 160 He often deviates from prepared remarks 161 and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\". 162 163 164 165 The New York Times wrote that Biden\u0027s \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\". 163 2008 presidential campaign Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa , July 2007 Biden chose not to run for president in 1992 in part because he had voted against authorizing the Gulf War , 137 and did not run in 2004 because, he said, he felt he had little chance of winning and could best serve the country by remaining in the Senate. 166 In January 2007, he declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections . 167 During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War , his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience. Biden rejected speculation that he might become Secretary of State , 168 focusing on only the presidency. 169 In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama\u0027s, saying of the latter, \"I think he can be ready, but right now I don\u0027t believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training.\" 170 Biden also said Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. 148 Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani : \"There\u0027s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\" 171 Overall, Biden\u0027s debate performances were an effective mixture of humor and sharp and disciplined comments. 172 :336 Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton . 173 He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates . In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses , garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates. 174 He withdrew from the race that evening. 175 Despite its lack of success, Biden\u0027s 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world. 172 :336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , they had not been close: Biden resented Obama\u0027s quick rise to political stardom, 148 176 while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing. 172 :28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden\u0027s campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\". 176 172 :28, 337–338 2008 vice-presidential campaign Main articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign and 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois Shortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration. 177 Biden declined Obama\u0027s first request to vet him for the vice-presidential slot, fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his Senate position, but he later changed his mind. 148 178 In a June 22, 2008 interview, Biden said that while he was not actively seeking the vice-presidential nomination, he would accept it if offered. 179 In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility, 177 and developed a strong personal rapport. 176 On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate . 180 The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience—and not to help the ticket win a swing state or to emphasize Obama\u0027s \"change\" message. 181 Others pointed out Biden\u0027s appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters, as well as his willingness to aggressively challenge Republican nominee John McCain in a way that Obama seemed uncomfortable doing at times. 182 183 In accepting Obama\u0027s offer, Biden ruled out running for president again in 2016, 177 but his comments in later years seemed to back off that stance, as he did not want to diminish his political power by appearing uninterested in advancement. 184 185 186 Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver . 187 Biden\u0027s vice-presidential campaigning gained little media visibility, as far greater press attention was focused on the Republican running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin . 163 188 During one week in September 2008, for instance, the Pew Research Center \u0027s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that Biden was included in only five percent of coverage of the race, far less than the other three candidates on the tickets received. 189 Biden nevertheless focused on campaigning in economically challenged areas of swing states and trying to win over blue-collar Democrats, especially those who had supported Hillary Clinton . 148 163 Biden attacked McCain heavily despite a long-standing personal friendship. n 3 He said, \"That guy I used to know, he\u0027s gone. It literally saddens me.\" 163 As the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted in favor of the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , which went on to pass in the Senate 74–25. 191 On October 2, 2008, Biden participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis . Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters\u0027 expectations, Biden had won the debate overall. 192 During the campaign\u0027s final days, he focused on less populated, older, less well-off areas of battleground states, especially Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, where polling indicated he was popular and where Obama had not campaigned or performed well in the Democratic primaries. 193 194 195 He also campaigned in some normally Republican states, as well as in areas with large Catholic populations. 195 Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama\u0027s being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention. 193 194 Privately, Biden\u0027s remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked. 172 :411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers referred to Biden blunders as \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden. 186 Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership. 172 :411–414 Publicly, Obama strategist David Axelrod said Biden\u0027s high popularity ratings had outweighed any unexpected comments. 196 Nationally, Biden had a 60% favorability rating in a Pew Research Center poll, compared to Palin\u0027s 44%. 193 On November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain–Palin\u0027s 173. 197 198 199 At the same time Biden was running for vice president he was also running for reelection to the Senate, 200 as permitted by Delaware law. 137 On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O\u0027Donnell . 201 Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009. 202 He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, \"In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator.\" 202 Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program , 203 and resigned from the Senate later that day. n 4 In an emotional farewell, Biden told the Senate: \"Every good thing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus years I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships.\" 207 Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed longtime Biden adviser Ted Kaufman to fill Biden\u0027s vacated Senate seat. 208 Vice president (2009–2017) Biden being sworn in as vice president on January 20, 2009 First term (2009–2013) Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush\u0027s vice president, Dick Cheney , and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency. 209 He chaired Obama\u0027s transition team 210 and headed an initiative to improve middle-class economic well-being. 211 In early January 2009, in his last act as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he visited the leaders of Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , 212 and on January 20 he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States 213 ‍—‌the first vice president from Delaware 214 and the first Roman Catholic vice president. 215 216 Obama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don\u0027t show up in the stat sheet\". 217 In May, Biden visited Kosovo and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\". 218 Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan , 219 220 but his skepticism was valued, 178 and in 2009, Biden\u0027s views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy. 221 Biden visited Iraq about every two months, 148 becoming the administration\u0027s point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there. 178 More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden\u0027s responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\" 222 Biden said Iraq \"could be one of the great achievements of this administration\". 223 His January 2010 visit to Iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming Iraqi parliamentary election resulted in 59 of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the Iraqi government two days later. 224 By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011. 225 226 President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011 Biden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession , and stressed that only worthy projects should get funding. 227 He talked with hundreds of governors, mayors, and other local officials in this role. 225 During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred, 178 and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent. 228 In late April 2009, Biden\u0027s off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak , that he would advise family members against traveling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction by the White House. 229 The remark revived Biden\u0027s reputation for gaffes . 230 221 231 Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. 232 On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\" during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied on Twitter, \"And yes Mr. Vice President, you\u0027re right ...\" 233 Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama\u0027s daughter Sasha and Biden\u0027s granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together. 186 Members of the Obama administration said Biden\u0027s role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions. 234 Rahm Emanuel , White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink . 217 White House press secretary Jay Carney , Biden\u0027s former communications director, said Biden played the role of \"the bad guy in the Situation Room\". 234 Another senior Obama advisor said Biden \"is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible.\" 178 Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\" 178 On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup , attended the England v. U.S. game , and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa. 235 The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware. 236 Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections , maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party. 237 Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , Biden\u0027s past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important. 238 239 He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty . 238 239 In December 2010, Biden\u0027s advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell , were instrumental in producing the administration\u0027s compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts . 239 240 Biden then took the lead in trying to sell the agreement to a reluctant Democratic caucus in Congress. 239 241 The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 . In foreign policy, Biden supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011. 242 He supported closer economic ties with Russia . 243 In March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown. 244 By May 2011, a \"Biden panel\" with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan. 245 246 The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden\u0027s relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011 , signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed. 247 248 249 Biden had spent the most time of anyone in the administration bargaining with Congress on the debt question, 248 and one Republican staffer said, \"Biden\u0027s the only guy with real negotiating authority, and McConnell knows that his word is good. He was a key to the deal.\" 247 Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden , 225 250 lest failure adversely affect Obama\u0027s reelection prospects. 251 252 He took the lead in notifying Congressional leaders of the successful outcome. 253 Reelection Main article: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign In October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election , 237 but with Obama\u0027s popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton. 254 The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama, 254 and White House officials later said Obama had never entertained the idea. 255 Biden and Obama, July 2012 Biden\u0027s May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama\u0027s position, which had been described as \"evolving\". 256 Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention, and since Biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key Catholic voters be offended. 186 257 258 259 Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden\u0027s statement, 257 and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden\u0027s remarks. 260 Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out, 258 261 while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart. 257 The incident showed that Biden still struggled at times with message discipline , 186 as Time wrote, \"Everyone knows Biden\u0027s greatest strength is also his greatest weakness.\" 225 Relations were also strained between the vice presidential and presidential campaigns when Biden appeared to use his position to bolster fundraising contacts for a possible run for president in 2016 , and he ended up being excluded from Obama campaign strategy meetings. 254 The Obama campaign nevertheless valued Biden as a retail-level politician who could connect with disaffected blue-collar workers and rural residents, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012. 262 225 An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y\u0027all back in chains\" led to a similar analysis of Biden\u0027s face-to-face campaigning abilities versus his tendency to go off track. 262 263 264 The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Most candidates give the same stump speech over and over, putting reporters if not the audience to sleep. But during any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion.\" 263 Time magazine wrote that Biden often went too far and \"Along with the familiar Washington mix of neediness and overconfidence, Biden\u0027s brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness.\" 262 Biden was nominated for a second term as vice president at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in September. 265 Debating his Republican counterpart, Representative Paul Ryan , in the vice-presidential debate on October 11 he made a spirited and emotional defense of the Obama administration\u0027s record and energetically attacked the Republican ticket. 266 267 On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection 268 over Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote. 269 In December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force , created to address the causes of gun violence in the United States in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . 270 Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \" fiscal cliff \", Biden\u0027s relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013. 271 272 It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels. 272 Second term (2013–2017) Biden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle , his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21). 273 He continued to be in the forefront as, in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , the Obama administration put forth executive orders and proposed new gun control measures 90 (they failed to pass). 274 Biden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 , which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 . This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations. 275 276 277 Biden\u0027s Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls , begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault , begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs. 278 279 Biden discussed federal guidelines on sexual assault on university campuses while giving a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He said, \"No means no, if you\u0027re drunk or you\u0027re sober. No means no if you\u0027re in bed, in a dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind. No means no.\" 280 281 282 In line with his efforts supporting victims of sex crimes, Biden made a cameo appearance on Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit as Vice President, in support of clearing the backlog of rape kits. 283 284 Biden favored arming Syria\u0027s rebel fighters . 285 As Iraq fell apart during 2014 , renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along. 286 287 Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\". 288 On December 8, 2015, Biden spoke in Ukraine\u0027s parliament in Kyiv 289 in one of his many visits to set U.S. aid and policy stance on Ukraine. 290 291 Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president. 292 Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem , March 9, 2016 In 2015, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invited Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress without notifying the Obama administration. This defiance of protocol led Biden and more than 50 congressional Democrats to skip Netanyahu\u0027s speech. 293 In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia , where he met with Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War. 294 In Kosovo, he attended a ceremony renaming a highway after his son Beau, in honor of Beau\u0027s service to Kosovo in training its judges and prosecutors. 295 296 297 Biden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate , making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction. 298 Biden with Vice President-elect Mike Pence on November 10, 2016 Role in the 2016 presidential campaign During his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination . 299 With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton \u0027s favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established. 299 300 301 As of September 11, 2015 update , Biden was still uncertain about running. He cited his son\u0027s recent death as a large drain on his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they\u0027re willing to give it 110% of who they are.\" 302 On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016. 303 304 305 In January 2016, Biden affirmed that it was the right decision, but admitted to regretting not running for president \"every day\". 306 After Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton on June 9, 2016, Biden endorsed her later that day. 307 Throughout the 2016 election , Biden strongly criticized Clinton\u0027s opponent, Donald Trump, in often colorful terms. 308 309 Subsequent activities (2017–2021) Biden with his two predecessors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump , at the latter\u0027s inauguration on January 20, 2017 After leaving the vice presidency, Biden became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania , while continuing to lead efforts to find treatments for cancer. 310 In 2017 he wrote a memoir, Promise Me, Dad , and went on a book tour. 311 Biden earned $15.6 million in 2017–2018. 312 In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain , praising McCain\u0027s embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships. 313 Biden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump . 314 315 316 He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency. 317 318 In 2019, Biden criticized Brunei for its intention to implement Islamic laws that would allow death by stoning for adultery and homosexuality, calling it \"appalling and immoral\" and saying, \"There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity.\" 319 By 2019, Biden and his wife reported that their assets had increased to between $2.2 million and $8 million from speaking engagements and a contract to write a set of books. 320 2020 presidential campaign Speculation and announcement Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia , May 2019 Between 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020. 321 When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\". 322 At one point he suggested he did not see a scenario where he would run again, 323 324 but a few days later, he said, \"I\u0027ll run if I can walk.\" 325 A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden\u0027s entry into the race. 326 Biden said he would decide whether to run by January 2019, 327 but made no announcement at that time. Friends said he was \"very close to saying yes\" but was concerned about the effect another presidential run could have on his family and reputation, as well as fundraising struggles and perceptions about his age and relative centrism. 328 He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019, 329 saying he was prompted to run by his \"sense of duty\", offense at the Trump presidency, what he felt was a lack of foreign policy experience among other Democratic hopefuls, and his desire to foster \"bridge-building progressivism\" in the party. 328 Campaign In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden . 330 Despite the allegations, as of September 2019, no evidence has been produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens. 331 332 333 The media widely interpreted this pressure to investigate the Bidens as trying to hurt Biden\u0027s chances of winning the presidency, resulting in a political scandal 334 335 and Trump\u0027s impeachment by the House of Representatives. Beginning in 2019, Trump and his allies falsely accused Biden of getting the Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin fired because he was supposedly pursuing an investigation into Burisma Holdings , which employed Hunter Biden. Biden was accused of withholding $1 billion in aid from Ukraine in this effort. In 2015, Biden pressured the Ukrainian parliament to remove Shokin because the United States, the European Union and other international organizations considered Shokin corrupt and ineffective, and in particular because Shokin was not assertively investigating Burisma. The withholding of the $1 billion in aid was part of this official policy. 336 337 338 339 Throughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls. 340 341 Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses , and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary . 342 343 He performed better in the Nevada caucuses , reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still was behind Bernie Sanders by 21.6 percentage points. 344 Making strong appeals to black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points. 345 After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar , he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests , including Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, putting him in the lead overall. 346 Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states (Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, and Missouri) on March 10. 347 When Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party\u0027s presumptive nominee for president. 348 On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes. 349 Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day. 350 In March 2020, Biden committed to choosing a woman as his running mate. 351 In June, Biden met the 1,991-delegate threshold needed to secure the party\u0027s presidential nomination. 352 On August 11, he announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket. 353 On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election . 354 355 356 Allegations of inappropriate physical contact Biden has been accused several times of inappropriate non-sexual contact, such as embracing, kissing, and other forms of physical contact. 357 358 He has described himself as a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior has caused trouble for him in the past. 359 By 2015, a series of swearings-in and other events at which Biden had placed his hands on people and talked closely to them attracted attention in the press and on social media. 360 361 362 Various people defended Biden, including a senator who issued a statement, 363 as well as Stephanie Carter, a woman whose photograph with Biden had gone viral, who described the photo as \"misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends\". 364 In February 2016, Biden gave a speech about sexual assault awareness at the 88th Academy Awards , before introducing Lady Gaga . 365 In March 2019, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores alleged that Biden had touched her without her consent at a 2014 campaign rally in Las Vegas. In an op-ed, Flores wrote that Biden had walked up behind her, put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair, and kissed the back of her head, adding that the way he touched her was \"an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners—and I felt powerless to do anything about it.\" 366 Biden\u0027s spokesman said Biden did not recall the behavior described. 367 Two days later, Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Jim Himes , said Biden touched her in a non-sexual but inappropriate way by holding her head to rub noses with her at a political fundraiser in Greenwich in 2009. 368 The next day, two more women came forward with allegations of unwanted touching claiming that he touched a woman\u0027s leg during a meeting, and that he placed his hand on a woman\u0027s back during a photo. 369 370 In early April 2019, three women told The Washington Post Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. 371 Also in April 2019, former Biden staffer Tara Reade said she had felt uncomfortable on several occasions when Biden touched her on her shoulder and neck during her employment in his Senate office in 1993. 372 In March 2020, Reade accused him of a 1993 sexual assault . 373 Biden and his campaign vehemently denied the allegation. 374 375 The New York Times investigated and \"found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden\". 373 Biden apologized for not understanding how people would react to his actions, but said his intentions were honorable and that he would be more \"mindful of people\u0027s personal space\". He went on to say he was not sorry for anything he had ever done, which led critics to accuse him of sending a mixed message. 376 Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian said it was \"frustrating to see conservatives... weaponize the accusations against Biden\", but that it was \"also frustrating to see so many liberals turn a blind eye\". 377 Presidential transition Further information: Presidential transition of Joe Biden Biden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020.
